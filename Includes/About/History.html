                            Subbamma was one of the lowest of the low. 
                            Her very shadow was considered “unclean” by high-caste Hindus. 
                            Married as a “child bride,” she proved barren, and was judged “cursed” by her husband’s family. 
                            After 35 years of ill treatment, she determined to kill herself and to end it all.

                <div class="w-[320px] justify-center items-center flex flex-col">

 <div class="mt-[10px]">As she neared the river to throw herself in, 
she met a British missionary, Mr. Charles 
Whitehouse. This divine encounter resulted in 
her inviting Jesus to be her Lord and Savior. God 
piled grace upon grace as she rejoined her
 husband, quickly became pregnant, and was
  reconciled with his family.</div>

<div class="mt-[10px]">Subbamma journeyed from despair to hope.
 This new Christian tackled the injustice around
  her as she became a follower of Christ. Denied
   the right to earn a living, she taught herself and
    the women of the village to make lace and
     export it to support themselves. She gathered
      the unwanted illegitimate children whose
       untouchable mothers were forced to bear them.
        And having taught herself to read and write,
         she gathered these children and taught and fed
          them in a one-room dirt-floored hut. Because
           the untouchables were denied medical care, she
            trained herself to be a midwife and taught other
             women about safe childbearing.</div>

<div class="mt-[10px]">Through her living faith, her village began to be
 transformed by Christ. When she died, prior to
  her 99th birthday, her grandson, Dr. S. Darwin,
   brought her body from the U.S. to Mori, India for
    burial. Her grandson participated in an 8 hour
     long funeral service where for the first time, he
      heard testimonies from people, who were
       birthed, named, educated, trained, employed</div>
        and adopted by her.

            I lived in India with my grandmother until I was a young teenager.
            I shared in village life. My first school was her dirt-floored hut.
            When my family came to America my grandmother continued to support
            her projects in India through her modest income. She prayed earnestly
            for India and nurtured me with her vision. As I walked in the funeral
            procession toward her final resting place in Mori, we passed the little
            one-room school she had started. It was then I felt God say,
            “You are to continue Subbamma’s work.”
